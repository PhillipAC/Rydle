<h2>Rules:</h2>
<p>
    Rydle is a game where you try to guess what year an event took place.<br>
    In normal play the event will take place some year on this day in history.<br>
    In random play the event will be any event in the past<br><br>

    For each guess each digit of the year will get one of three results. <br><br>

    <strong>Green:</strong> The digit is correct<br>
    <strong>Yellow:</strong> The digit is in the incorrect place<br>
    <strong>Black:</strong> The digit is not in the answer<br><br>

    Once you are down to one unknown digit an additional hint will be given.<br><br>

    <strong>↑:</strong> The event happened after the guess<br>
    <strong>↓:</strong> The event happened before the guess<br><br>

    Try to find the year the event took place as quick as you can!
